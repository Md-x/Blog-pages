This article will discuss how to make a choice that’s suitable for you.</p><p>Before you begin, you need to know your business goals, objectives, budget and timeline.</p><p>Understand and outline the goals you want to achieve from working with a digital marketing agency. Further break these down into specific deliverables, this will make it easy to communicate what you need and hope to get out of a project easily. When you are in discussion with the digital marketing agency you want to outsource to, you don’t spend so much time figuring out if they can help you.</p><p>For instance, you want a company blog that updated regularly</p><p>Assume you want to hire a digital marketing agency to develop a content marketing system to suit your business. You want a blog that is constantly updated with no input from you.</p><p>Goal: to attract the right visitors to your website who become loyal readers with high quality content.</p><p>Objective: a company blog to be completely managed by someone else.</p><p>Deliverable: a content marketing, plan, strategy, and system managed by someone else.</p><p>Knowing this, you can now hunt for a digital marketing agency that fits the description, because you know exactly what you need and can communicate this clearly.</p><p>To not be overwhelmed by the abbreviations some digital marketing companies could use, you can refer to this at any time;</p><p>CPA – Cost per Acquisition</p><p>CTR – Click Through Rate</p><p>CRO – Conversation Rate Optimization</p><p>ROI – Return on Investment</p><p>PPC – Pay Per Click</p><p>SERP – Search Engine Result Page</p><p>SEO – Search Engine Optimization</p><p>SMM – Social Media Marketing</p><p>UX – User Experience</p><p>UI – User Interface</p><p>Now, here are the characteristics that make a great digital marketing agency that you can look out for.</p><ol><li><strong></strong><strong>Solid industry reputation</strong></li></ol><p>A company, not just a digital marketing agency should have reviews or testimonials from clients they have worked with. This is important as it helps potential customers like yourself know if to trust or rely on a company.</p><p>Either a positive or negative review, you get to know what others found pleasant or frustrating when working with the company, then you decide if this is something you can manage.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong></strong><strong>Team members with experience</strong></li></ol><p>The agency you want to work with should have team members that suit your project. Their designated roles and experience should match what you need to achieve. If the company does not put this on their website, you can do some research on LinkedIn.</p><p>Though not all companies showcase everyone on their team, you can ask questions during your consultation if you want clarification.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong></strong><strong>A portfolio and/or list of clients</strong></li></ol><p>Digital marketing requires time and effort. Great digital marketing agencies are always proud to share who they have worked with for everyone to see. Specially to make potential customers interested.</p><p>It is not mandatory to know all their clients, however it makes the process easier. They may include some of the activities associated with digital marketing, however, if you don’t find services like SEO and Content Marketing displayed in their portfolio, it can be excused, these sort of services are not easy to showcase.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong></strong><strong>A well-designed &amp; functional website</strong></li></ol><p>As a website is the simplest way to build trust with a customer, you want a digital marketing agency with a well-designed website. This simply tells you that they are also doing the work you intend to hire them for, for themselves. So, they are capable of delivering the something better than theirs for you.</p><p>This is even more exciting if they offer website design and development services.</p><ol start="5"><li><strong></strong><strong>Easy on the promises</strong></li></ol><p>A perfect example – if you visit an agency’s website and for SEO, they claim that they can take your business to the number one spot on Google quickly would be a clear indication that they do not know what they are doing. A great digital marketing agency would know that SEO is a long-term and short-term strategy that requires consistent maintenance.</p><p>Think about what you already know about your industry and if the promises an agency makes that seems impossible are constantly talked about, know that this is a red flag, and you need to abort.</p><ol start="6"><li><strong></strong><strong>Easy to reach</strong></li></ol><p>Some digital marketing agencies don’t have their contact information on their website, others have, and it is not valid. The best agencies make it easy for customers to get in touch with them. Also, they provide different options for how you can reach them.</p><p>Usually, you would find a contact form to fill out for further inquiry or you can simply click to call/ send a message.</p><p>The best digital marketing agencies are excellent at one or two things with their other services being complimentary to these services.  So, choose a digital marketing agency specializing in the types of services you need if you want the best results and the most value for your money.</p><p>When it comes to outsourcing/choosing a digital marketing agency, you now know what to look for, and what to avoid.
